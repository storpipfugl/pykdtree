            The number of nearest neighbours to return
        eps : non-negative float
            Return approximate nearest neighbours; the k-th returned value
            is guaranteed to be no further than (1 + eps) times the distance
            to the real k-th nearest neighbour
        distance_upper_bound : non-negative float
            Return only neighbors within this distance.
            This is used to prune tree searches.
        sqr_dists : bool, optional
            Internally pykdtree works with squared distances.
            Determines if the squared or Euclidean distances are returned.
        mask : numpy array, optional
            Array of booleans where neighbors are considered invalid and
            should not be returned. A mask value of True represents an
            invalid pixel. Mask should have shape (n,) to match data points.
            By default all points are considered valid.
