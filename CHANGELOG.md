Fix Python 3.9 wheels not being built for linux

## v1.3.3

Add compatibility to python 3.9

## v1.3.2

Change OSX installation to not use OpenMP without conda interpreter

## v1.3.1

Fix masking in the "query" method introduced in 1.3.0

## v1.3.0

Keyword argument "mask" added to "query" method. OpenMP compilation now works for MS Visual Studio compiler

## v1.2.2

Build process fixes

## v1.2.1Fixed OpenMP thread safety issue introduced in v1.2.0

## v1.2.0

64 and 32 bit MSVC Windows support added

## v1.1.1

Build process improvements. Add data attribute to kdtree class for scipy interface compatibility

## v1.0

Switched license from GPLv3 to LGPLv3

## v0.3

Avoid zipping of installed egg

## v0.2

Reduced memory footprint. Can now handle single precision data internally avoiding copy conversion to double precision. Default leafsize changed from 10 to 16 as this reduces the memory footprint and makes it a cache line multiplum (negligible if any query performance observed in benchmarks). Reduced memory allocation for leaf nodes. Applied patch for building on OS X.

## v0.1

Initial version.
